      <h2>About StrokePredict</h2>
      <p>
        StrokePredict is a machine learning-based web application designed to help individuals assess their risk of stroke based on key health indicators such as age, glucose level, blood pressure, and medical history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to provide early warning signs using AI to support proactive health care decisions. This tool is not a substitute for professional medical advice but a supplementary screening aid.
      </p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter basic medical information such as age, gender, hypertension, glucose level, and more.</li>
        <li>The model processes the inputs using a trained machine learning algorithm.</li>
        <li>The system displays the likelihood (probability) of stroke risk.</li>
        <li>You can use the result to make informed decisions or consult a healthcare provider.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>
